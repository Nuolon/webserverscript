# webserverscript
A script that automatically enables a LAMP-stack in a linux (CentOS Specifically) environment. Consists out of a webserver (apache,httpd), php+addons and a MariaDB-server instance. It is technically secure if you change the password used within the script for the moodledb admin account; I just changed it before pushing.
